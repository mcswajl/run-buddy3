    <h1>A little about me</h1>

    <p>
        I graduated from UNCC in 2001 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geography and Earth Science. I work for an Engineering firm for 2 years before moving over to current place of employment, Mecklenburg County. I have been with Mecklenburg County for 19 years, and my primary responsibility is managing the Flood Information and Notification System (FINS).
    <p>
        My wife (Wendy) and I have been married for 17 years, we have a 14-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. We live in Mount Holly, NC, just West of the City of Charlotte.
    <p>
        I have always wanted to learn coding personally but also to improve my professional skills.
    </p>
